# Predict the Fuel Efficiency of Several Cars

# How do the properties of a car impact it's fuel efficiency?
1) To try to answer this question, we'll work with a dataset containing fuel efficiencies of several cars compiled by Carnegie Mellon University.
2) The file doesn't contain the column names unfortunately so you'll have to extract the column names from auto-mpg.names and specify them manually. 

As specified in auto-mpg.names, the dataset contains 7 numerical features that could have an effect on a car's fuel efficiency:

cylinders -- the number of cylinders in the engine.
displacement -- the displacement of the engine.
horsepower -- the horsepower of the engine.
weight -- the weight of the car.
acceleration -- the acceleration of the car.
model year -- the year that car model was released (e.g. 70 corresponds to 1970).
origin -- where the car was manufactured (0 if North America, 1 if Europe, 2 if Asia).
