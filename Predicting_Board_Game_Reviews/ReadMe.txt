Board Game Reviews


Board games have been making a comeback lately, and deeper, more strategic boardgames, like Settlers of Catan have become hugely popular. A popular site where these types of board games are discussed and reviewed is BoardGameGeek.

In this project, I have worked with a data set that contains 80000 board games and their associated review scores. The data was scraped from BoardGameGeek and compiled into CSV format

Descriptive statistics about the board game, as well as review information

name: name of the board game.
playingtime: the playing time (given by the manufacturer).
minplaytime: the minimum playing time (given by the manufacturer).
maxplaytime: the maximum playing time (given by the manufacturer).
minage: the minimum recommended age to play.
users_rated: the number of users who rated the game.
average_rating: the average rating given to the game by users. (0-10)
total_weights: Number of weights given by users. 
average_weight: the average of all the subjective weights (0-5).


Findings: One interesting machine learning task might be to find the Error rate of the Model using the Error Metric.
